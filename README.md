# Next.js v13 with new app dir structure in combination with i18next

This example shows a basic way to use [i18next](https://www.i18next.com) (and [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com)) in a Next.js app with the new app dir structure.
[next-i18next](https://next.i18next.com) is not needed anymore for this setup.

It shows i18next integration on some server side pages and some client side pages.

There is also an example middleware with language detection and persistence via cookie.

*This example has been created out of [this discussion](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next/discussions/1993).*
